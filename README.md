# AWS - how to rotate secrets using

Description of implementation

We want to rotate every 90 days the value defined in the Secrets Manager as key/value pair /myApp-1/myGroup-1/mySecret-1 with Encryption key aws/secretsmanager
This the secret will have a rotation defined.
This rotation will have a lambda function associated that needs to be created only first time (todo).
This lambda will replace the key with a new one (using your custom method to encrypt).
The role attached to the lambda needs to have a new policy for allowing it to modify the secret (todo).
Each time a new secret is using the lambda we need to add its arn in the previous policy
if all ok: after a rotation there will be another version for the AWSCURRENT and the previous version will be marked with AWSPREVIOUS.

Steps to add a rotation for a secret
1. In the secret details go to Rotation and click Edit rotation
2. Check Automatic rotation and fill all the fields:
   1. ![alt text](configure-rotation.png)
3. In the Rotation function: if this is the first rotation we will need to click Create function (if we already have a rotation we need just to select the function from the dropdown)
4. When creating a lambda function we need to select Author from scratch, Function name=myrotation-t1-test, Runtime=python, Architecture=x86_64 and click Create function
5. In the function page we need to add our code in the lambda_function.py ( I have used a simple hmac encoding):

6. Save it and than we can click Test. After checking it we need to click Deploy
7. Here, on the lambda page, on Configuration tab select Permissions and click Add permissions button and select AWS service, Secrets Manager, any Statement ID, Principal=secretsmanager.amazonaws.com, Action=lambda:InvokeFunction and click Save
   1. ![alt text](lambda-permissions.png)
8. Back on the function page click on the role in order to edit it
9. In the role page on the Permissions tab we need to click Add permissions
   1.  if the policy (let call it my-rotation-secrets) already exists we just need to select it
   2.  if the my-rotation-secrets policy doesn’t exist we need to create it
        ```json 
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
                    "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                    "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue",
                    "secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<accountid>:secret:/myApp-1/myGroup-1/mySecret-1-12345"
        }
        ```
        in the Resource field we need to add the ARN of the secret
10. Going back to the page of the secret on the Rotation tab on Edit Rotation we will use the newly created lambda function

Testing
1. click Rotate secret immediately in the Rotation tab of the secret page and wait ~1 minute
2. check then Versions tab to see if you have new AWSCURRENT and the old version has now  AWSPREVIOUS label. If you see anything else beside just 2 versions (AWSCURRENT and AWSPREVIOUS) then the rotation had errors
3. for debugging go to the lambda page
4. here in the Monitor tab click View CloudWatch logs
5. here check the Log streams
6. also in the code of the lambda we can use print(<message>) and the message will also be displayed in the CloudWatch logs

What’s next
Transform lambda code from python to c#
